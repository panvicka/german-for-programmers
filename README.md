# German for programmers 

Hi. I am leaning German, I work as a programmer and I have to communicate in German fairly offten.

Being honest I do not *really* enjoy German and I am probably not very good at it. Most of the struggle comes from talking about my code and referencing stuff like "square bracket, pointers, continous delivery..."

I am trying to change my attitude. I was looking for a textbook or dictionary designed for programmers that would help me.

Funny Story. There is none. And, being a programmer, if I can't find something I just build it myself.

## For people learning German

I think you will find some usefull stuff here. But (!) not everything in this repo is correct. Use with care. Make your own research. 

## For native German speaker

If you spot a mistake **PLEASE** make a pull request.
